I am a rising senior at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I double major mathematics (with honors) and computer science. My (math) honors thesis advisor is [Kiran Kedlaya](https://kskedlaya.org/). 

I worked as a TA and Research Assistant for the [math department](https://math.ucsd.edu/). I participated in the [RTG program](https://math.ucsd.edu/~rtgagant/rtgreading.html) (Graduate directed reading for undergraduates) in Spring 2021, where I was reading "Representation of Quivers" under Tanny Libman.

I am a participant of Caltech's [SURF](http://sfp.caltech.edu/programs/surf) program for 2020 and 2021, where I was advised by [Chris Umans](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~umans/).
